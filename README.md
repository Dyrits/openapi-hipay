# HiPay OpenAPI / Swagger specifications

HiPay provides various APIs to help you accept payments on your website or mobile application, implement subscription billing, make payouts, and much more.

This repository contains HiPay API specifications, represented in the [OpenAPI standard](https://www.openapis.org/) (formerly known as Swagger Specification).

## Folder structure

Specifications are using the OpenAPI 3.0.0 format and we provide them in `.yaml` format.

This repository only contains the latest version of our API specification grouped by our solutions. However, you can find the API version for each of our products inside the corresponding file.

## Usage

There are multiple ways you can use the OpenAPI specification to explore the HiPay API:

- If you want to see the OpenAPI specification in action, please visit the [HiPay API Developer portal](https://developer.hipay.com/).
- If you prefer to use the classic Swagger toolset, upload these specifications to the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) or [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/).
- Also we recommend you use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/postman) to import the OpenAPI specification and create your personal collection of requests.
