  description: "\nThe Gateway API allows you to get paid and manage orders and transactions.\n\nPlease note: this documentation describes the Gateway API parameters and response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.\nThis page is to be used alongside the **[HiPay Enterprise Platform Overview documentation](/getting-started/platform-hipay-enterprise/overview/)**, which gives you more information and details on the HiPay Enterprise workflow. You may use both documents in parallel when integrating HiPay Enterprise.\n\n# Integration\n\nChoose from three types of integration to select the one best adapted to your business:\n\n## Hosted integration\n\nHiPay Enterprise hosts your payment page on a secured site. With this option you can benefit from a single point of contact, adaptable payment pages, and the PCI-DSS standard. You can therefore outsource heavy security requirements that are related to payment acceptance.\n\nIn order to use this integration, please refer to the **Generate Hosted Payment Page (`POST /hpayment`)** API service below.\n\n## iFrame integration\n\nThis is a hybrid solution in which the buyer remains on your website to make payment. In order to use this integration you need to generate a hosted payment page (as above) with a special template, allowing you to properly display it in an iFrame.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the **Generate Hosted Payment Page (`POST /hpayment`)** documentation below.\n\n## Integration via our API\n\nIn this case, the payment page is hosted on your website, allowing you to have a unified, fully customized workflow. Please refer to the **Request New Order API (`POST Order`)** below for more information.\n\nPlease note that if you want to execute transactions with credit or debit card payment products, you will need to tokenize card numbers beforehand by using the HiPay Enterprise Tokenization API.\n\n# Managing transactions\n\nOnce a transaction is executed, you may need to perform operations on it, such as a refund, a capture, etc. To do so, please refer to the `maintenance` web service.\n\nYou can also get all transaction details at any time by leveraging the `transaction` web services.\n\nBesides, you may need to be automatically informed when a transaction status gets updated. To this end, you need to leverage server-to-server notifications. For more information, please check the [HiPay Enterprise Overview](/getting-started/platform-hipay-enterprise/overview/#server-to-server-notifications).\n\n# Web service information\n\n## Gateway API base URLs\n\n *\n| Environment | Base URL |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stage | [https://stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/](https://stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/) |\n| Production | [https://secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/](https://secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/) |\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll requests to the HiPay Enterprise API require identification through *HTTP Basic Authentication*. Your API credentials can be found in the Integration section of your HiPay Enterprise back office. Most HTTP clients (including web browsers) have built-in support for HTTP basic authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP requests.\n\n`Authorization: Basic base64('API login>:<API password>')`"

      summary: 'Creates a secure payment page to which you can redirect your customer to proceed checkout'
      description: "This service allows you to **redirect your user to a payment page\n(hosted by HiPay)** in order to proceed checkout. This service creates\nan order and returns a forward URL. This forward URL is dedicated to\ndisplay a payment page with your CSS and validated payment products.\nAfter payment form validation, the checkout is processed and the user is\nbeing returned to your website.\n\nAccording to transaction state and `authentication_indicator` parameter (see below), the user will be redirected either to the accept or the decline page.\n\nThere are two strategies for implementing this service:\n\n### Hosted: Full redirection mode\n\nOnce the payment page is created, you redirect your user to it. Your user is redirected back to your website once the transaction si executed.\n\n### iFrame mode\n\nYou may also display the payment page in an iFrame, in order to have a unified checkout workflow. To do so, you have to provide the `template` parameter with the value `iframe-js` (see below)."

      description: "This service allows you to execute transactions through API with no need to redirect your customer to the payment page hosted by HiPay. This service supports payments with credit or debit cards as well as alternative payment methods.\nIn **order** to make a payment with a credit or debit card, a token must have been generated beforehand. In fact, this service cannot receive credit or debit card numbers in clear. Instead, you must provide this service with a token associated to a card number. Use the HiPay Enterprise SDK for JavaScript in order to generate tokens.\nIf you need to make payments with alternative payment methods, you can use this service directly. Note that the use of some alternative payment products implies that you redirect your user to an external URL. In such a case, the `forwardUrl` parameter will be set with the appropriate URL. Moreover, the activation of *3-D Secure* also implies a redirection of your customer."
